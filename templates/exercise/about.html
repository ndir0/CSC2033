          <h2 class="h4">Why should you Exercise?</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Exercise can help to reduce your risk of of major illnesses such as coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2
            diabetes and cancer and lower your risk of early death by up to 30%. There is strong scientific evidence
            that being physically active can help you live a happier and healthier life. Research shows that regular
            exercise can boost self-esteem, mood, sleep quality and energy, as well as reducing your risk of stress,
            clinical depression, dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

            Regular exercise is medically proven to lower your risk of:

          <p>
            To stay healthy, the UK Chief Medical Officers' Physical Activity Guidelines, on GOV.UK, state that adults
            should try to be active every day and aim to do at least 150 minutes of physical activity over a week,
            through a variety of activities.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            For most people the best way to get active is to start small. Things like walking or cycling to school or
            work. If this isn't feasible try joining your local sports club. Many welcome new and inexperienced members.
            The more you do the better you will feel and healthier you'll get!
          </p>
          <p>
            For any type of activity to benefit your health, you need to be moving quick enough to raise your heart
            rate, breathe faster and feel warmer. This level of effort is called moderate intensity activity. If you're
            working at a moderate intensity you should still be able to talk but you won't be able to sing the words to
            a song.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            An activity where you have to work even harder is called vigorous intensity activity. There is substantial
            evidence that vigorous activity can bring health benefits over and above that of moderate activity. You can
            tell when it's vigorous activity because you're breathing hard and fast, and your heart rate has gone up
            quite a bit. If you're working at this level, you won't be able to say more than a few words without pausing
            for a breath.
          </p>
          <h5 class="h4">A modern problem</h5>
          <p>
            People are less active nowadays, partly because technology has made our lives easier. We drive cars or take
            public transport. Machines wash our clothes. We entertain ourselves in front of a TV or computer screen.
            Fewer people are doing manual work, and most of us have jobs that involve little physical effort. Work,
            household chores, shopping and other necessary activities are far less demanding than for previous generations.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            We move around less and burn off less energy than people used to. Research suggests that many adults spend
            more than 7 hours a day sitting down, at work, on transport or in their leisure time. People aged over 65
            spend 10 hours or more each day sitting or lying down, making them the most sedentary age group.
          </p>
          <h5 class="h4">Sedentary Lifestyles</h5>
          <p>
            Inactivity is described by the Department of Health and Social Care as a "silent killer". Evidence is
            emerging that sedentary behaviour, such as sitting or lying down for long periods, is bad for your health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only should you try to raise your activity levels, but you should also reduce the amount of time you and
            your family spend sitting down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Common examples of sedentary behaviour include watching TV, using a computer, using the car for short
            journeys and sitting down to read, talk or listen to music. This type of behaviour is thought to increase
            your risk of developing many chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, as well
            as weight gain and obesity.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Crucially, you can hit your weekly activity target but still be at risk of ill health if you spend the rest
            of the time sitting or lying down.
